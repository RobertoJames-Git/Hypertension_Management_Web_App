create a store procedure in mariadbsql that allows:
1) a health care prof to send a monitor request to the patient so they can monitor them
2) a patient to send a monitor request to the health care prof so they can monitored by them

Edge Cases:
1) We may have situations where a healthcare prof sends a request that is currently pending and the patient may also send a request to the health prof. In that instance what i want you to do is to modify the existing record to accepted and the attribute 'sentby' should still be username of the person that first sent the pending monitor request.
2) If the same person sends another monitor request then that record should be removed from the table and the procedure should just end. 
(Example:A health care prof sent a monitor request to a patient already then they try to send another one again or vice versa) In this instance their previous record should just be remove. What i am trying to simualate is a cancellation of the monitor request if it is sent twice. If it is the first time a request is being sent then it is added to the table but if a record already exist when a monitor request is being sent then the existsing record is removed.
