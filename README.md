## 📌 Overview

This project was completed as part of my 4th-year major project at the University of Technology, Jamaica. Students are required to choose either a **full research** or a **research plus mini-development** project. My group and I chose the latter and developed a **Digital Health Intervention (DHI) platform** for hypertensive patients.

The reserch section of this project was guided by the **UTAUT 2 framework**, which evaluates technology acceptance. Hypertension remains a leading health concern, and digital tools like this platform can improve adherence, monitoring, and communication between patients, family members, and healthcare professionals.
